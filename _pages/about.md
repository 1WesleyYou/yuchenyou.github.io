> **Seeking MS/PhD (Fall 2026) in Distributed Systems, Operating Systems, and Networking.**
{:.notice--primary}

I build **dependable systems**. At **Order Lab (UMich)** I’m developing an **agent-based auto-mitigation loop** on ZooKeeper/HDFS — *reproduce → measure → decide → mitigate* — powered by Prometheus SLOs, HAProxy/Resilience4j, and Chaos faults.

**From embedded/robotics to systems.** Earlier I shipped STM32/C++/Rust control stacks with **interrupt-driven concurrency**, **deterministic scheduling**, and **reliable fieldbus** (CAN/I²C). The same discipline now drives my OS/DS work on **threads/VM/NFS**, **network fault emulation**, and **SLO-driven recovery**.

### Research Focus
- **Distributed systems:** failure reproduction & **auto-mitigation**, SLO-driven observability  
- **Operating systems:** **concurrency**, VM/paging, interface hardening  
- **Networking:** dependable protocols, load shedding/failover, fault emulation
