> 🎓 **Seeking MS/PhD (Fall 2026) in Distributed Systems, Operating Systems, and Networking.**

👋 Hi, I'm Yuchen You

I'm a senior undergraduate in **Computer Science** at the **University of Michigan**, also pursuing a dual degree in **Mechanical Engineering** at **Shanghai Jiao Tong University**.

My research interests lie broadly in **operating systems, distributed systems, and computer networking**, with a focus on building *efficient and reliable system*. I am doing some related projects in agentic distributed system, MoE inference acceleration, etc.

Before focusing on systems research, I worked extensively in robotics and embedded system, where I designed and implemented real-time control stacks for many kinds of robots and autonomous systems. That hands-on experience with concurrency, feedback loops, and fault-tolerant control has strongly shaped how I now think about building robust, adaptive computer systems.

## Research Focus

- **Distributed systems:** failure reproduction & auto-mitigation; SLO-based observability  
- **Operating systems:** concurrency; VM/paging; interface hardening  
- **Networking:** dependable protocols; load shedding/failover; fault emulation

## Featured

- **Agentic DS Ops** (ZooKeeper/HDFS): automated loop $\rightarrow$ [project]()  
- **OS (EECS 482):** threads, COW+clock pager, Unix-style NFS $\rightarrow$ [projects](https://whoami-wesleyyou.top/yuchenyou.github.io/projects/)  
- **Soft Robotic Arm** (ICRA 2025 Workshop **Best Poster**) $\rightarrow$ [projects](https://whoami-wesleyyou.top/yuchenyou.github.io/projects/))
