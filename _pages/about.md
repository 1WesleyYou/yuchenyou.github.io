> **Actively seeking PhD positions (Fall 2026) in Operating Systems & Network Security.**
{:.notice--primary}

**Hello! I’m Yuchen You**, a dual-degree undergraduate in **Computer Science (University of Michigan)** and **Mechanical Engineering (Shanghai Jiao Tong University)**.  
I started in **embedded systems and robotics**—designing control architectures, writing real-time firmware (**STM32/C++/Rust**), and building pneumatic origami mechanisms—and I’m now channeling that experience into **systems security, operating systems, and dependable networking**.

I’ve built a **concurrent user-level OS kernel** (scheduling, virtual memory, NFS), modeled **Mininet** topologies with custom TCP and **DASH** streaming, and explored real-world attack vectors including **padding-oracle exploits, ROP chains,** and **steganalysis**. I’m passionate about hardening **kernels, protocols, and applications** against adversaries and pushing reliability in the face of faults.

### Research Interests
- **Operating Systems:** distributed systems, data consistency, reliability  
- **Networking:** network security; privacy in ML dataset training  
- **Security:** Unix kernel security design; ethical hacking  
- **Protocols & Simulation:** reliable network protocols; emulation & testbeds

### Education
- **B.S.E., Computer Science**, University of Michigan — *expected 2026*  
- **B.S.E., Mechanical Engineering**, Shanghai Jiao Tong University — *expected 2026*

### Beyond research
Rubik’s Cube challenges, badminton, and saxophone.
