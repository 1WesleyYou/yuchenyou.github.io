> **Seeking MS/PhD (Fall 2026) in Distributed Systems, Operating Systems, and Networking.**

Hi! I’m Yuchen (CS @ UMich, ME @ SJTU). At UMich **Order Lab** I’m building an **agent-based auto-mitigation loop** for distributed systems—*reproduce → measure → decide → mitigate*—on ZooKeeper/HDFS with **Prometheus SLOs**, **HAProxy/Resilience4j**, and **Chaos** faults.

**From embedded/robotics to systems.** Previously I shipped STM32/C++/Rust control stacks with **interrupt-driven concurrency**, **deterministic scheduling**, and **reliable fieldbus** (CAN/I²C). That discipline now powers my work on **threads/VM/NFS**, **network fault emulation**, and **SLO-driven recovery**.

## Research Focus
- **Distributed systems:** failure reproduction & auto-mitigation; SLO-based observability  
- **Operating systems:** concurrency; VM/paging; interface hardening  
- **Networking:** dependable protocols; load shedding/failover; fault emulation

## Featured
- **Agentic DS Ops** (ZooKeeper/HDFS): automated loop → [project](/projects/agentic-ds-ops)  
- **Teaching OS (EECS 482):** threads, COW+clock pager, Unix-style NFS → [projects](/projects/)  
- **Soft Robotic Arm** (ICRA 2025 Workshop **Best Poster**) → [projects](/projects/)
